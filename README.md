# Project Hub

This project is a web development practice endeavor focused on HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. It will feature a basic web environment with the following components:

- Workable Navigator: Intuitive navigation for users to explore different sections and features (Tho not working, tee-hee).
- Project Dashboard: A customizable dashboard for users to showcase their projects to others.
- Announcements: A section for users to post updates, news, and share content.
- Trending: Highlighting popular users and their trending projects.

The primary objective is to build a functional yet minimal website to hone web development skills. While the focus is on HTML and CSS, some JavaScript may be incorporated for enhanced functionality. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in web development.
